# Chef Cookie Cutter

This project is archived as of 2018-07-30.

Cookie Cutter is a Ruby Gem / Chef Cookbook combination, that extends the Chef
cookbook DSL with new features and possibilities.

It is mostly the result of me screwing around with Chef and Ruby metaprogramming.
It's motivation is purely educational and never intended to end up in anything
production critical.

Many of the features are questionable hacks. The documentation is crap, tests
are almost nonexistent and there never was any release workflow. There are
still some nifty bits and pieces in here, so if you find anything you like,
feel free to copy it at your leisure. Since I stopped development on the project
and archived it, I put everything into public domain.
